                <p>
                    I grew up just outside the small town of Brimfield located in central Illinois. I've lived near
                    Brimfield my entire life with my Mom, Dad, and older brother Zach. After graduating from Brimfield
                    High School in
                    2017, I went to college at the Univeristy of Iowa. At Iowa I am currently double majoring in Finance
                    and
                    Business Analytics and will be graduating in May. While at Iowa I have made some great friends and
                    been apart
                    of several amazing organizations. Some of my best memories at Iowa include storming Kinnick after
                    beating Ohio
                    State, playing basketball with friends at the field house, and of course nights out to the bars.

                <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <h4> Cambridge Investment Research</h4>
                <p>
                    Cambridge Investment Research is a Broker-Dealer based out of Fairfield, IA. I interned at Cambridge
                    from May 2020 through August 2020 and again from December 2020 until February 2021. I was originally
                    slated to intern in the Investments and Insurance department however, due to COVID-19 Cambridge was
                    unable to incorporate an online intern in this department. Cambridge was very flexible and was able
                    to
                    accommodate me in their Operations team. I worked remotely with the Operations department for both
                    of my
                    stints at Cambridge. While in Operations, I focused on a few projects which included improving the
                    webinar experiences for our financial professionals and moving client's records from our old
                    database
                    (Pinnacle) to our new database (OnBase).

                <h4>Maui Jim Sunglasses</h4>
                <p>
                    Maui Jim is a manufacturer of high-end polarized sunglasses. As of 2015, Maui Jim was the
                    third-largest sunglass producer in the world. It is currently headquartered in Peoria, IL, and was
                    founded in Lahaina, HI in 1980. I worked at Maui for two summers and one winter as a facilities
                    technician. My main duties were to maintain the grounds and assist with any larger-scale projects.
                    Some of the major projects I assisted with included remodeling bathrooms, installing drainage lines,
                    and renovating storm shelters.

                <h4>Kumon Math and Reading Center</h4>
                <p>
                    Kumon is a tutoring center that focuses on mathematics and reading primarily for young students. I
                    worked at Kumon for a couple of summers while in high school as a Teaching Assistant/Data Analyst. My
                    work included grading the students' homework and class assignments as well as assisting students
                    with in-class assignments. I also entered students' grades into our software program and then
                    generated reports on individual students for parents.
