                    I grew up just outside the small town of Brimfield located in central Illinois. I've lived near Brimfield my 
                    entire life with my Mom, Dad, and older brother Zach. After graduating from Brimfield High School in 2017 I  
                    went to college at the Univeristy of Iowa. At Iowa I am currently double majoring in Finance and Business 
                    Analytics and will be graduating in May. While at Iowa I have made some great friends and been apart of several 
                    amazing organizations. Some of my best memories from Iowa include storming Kinnick after beating Ohio State, 
                    playing basketball with friends at the field house, and of course nights out to the bars.
